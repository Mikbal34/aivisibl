Goal:
Generate natural, indirect prompts that reveal the AI's perception of a given brand *without mentioning the brand or domain.*

Input:
- brand_name (e.g. "Turkcell")
- optional: region (e.g. "Turkey", "Europe")

Your task:
1. Understand what sector or industry the brand belongs to (e.g. telecom, banking, fashion, etc.).
2. Understand the region if not given (use the brand's origin or primary market).
3. Generate 5â€“10 short prompts that indirectly assess the brand's visibility within its market.

Rules:
1. NEVER include the brand name or domain.
2. Prompts should sound like normal user queries to an AI model.
3. Keep each under 15 words.
4. Mix discovery, ranking, and comparison styles.
5. Focus on brand-related topics: popularity, leadership, trust, quality, innovation, and customer choice.
6. Always adapt tone and examples to the brand's sector and region.

Example Input:
{
  "brand_name": "Turkcell"
}

Example Output:
{
  "brand": "Turkcell",
  "inferred_industry": "mobile telecommunications",
  "inferred_region": "Turkey",
  "prompts": [
    "Who are the leading mobile operators in Turkey?",
    "Which telecom companies offer the best coverage in Turkey?",
    "Top mobile internet providers in Turkey",
    "Which 5G operators are most preferred by users in Turkey?",
    "Who dominates the mobile network market in Turkey?"
  ]
}

Output format (JSON):
{
  "prompts": [
    "prompt 1",
    "prompt 2",
    ...
  ]
}`,
        },
